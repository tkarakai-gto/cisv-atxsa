# Weekly call with Bob (Oct 18, 2017):

 - below $50K (confirm with accountant) we only do postcard 990-N only! We had to do that!!
 - Go with your own EIN!
 - incorporate date: self, on EIN number, we can try to get another from IRS
 - annual budget: next year's 3 columns: actual, mid, 2018, operating
 - 2 different budget: operating budget (including village), program budget separately.
 - Evaluation:
  - number of participants, number of host families, number of local people involved, happiness, etc. but what we are really looking for: local impact. ASK method (see proposal, last section) - impact on the participants (not locals or others), leadership programs hosted for JB
 - Past evaluation data: ask Laura or DFW
 - Year end financials: the audited financials, NOT NEEDED, just submit the internal, matching the first column in the budget.









# Kasey called (Oct 18):

 - She does not do anything unless told by USA (Chip Workman)
 - Never filed 990-N
 - Does not find when our chapter EIN was established
   - she found it later that day, uploaded to G Drive, Under Treasurer / Tax Forms










# Fall Chapter Report

Form filled in on cisv central

- **Have you completed Program Debriefing with the participants? How did it go?** -- Yes. The debriefing for both Village and Interchange was very productive, all families participated. The feedback was honest, very useful and documented. We feel that the debriefings helped to retain the families despite some had some negative experience.
- **How many people from your Chapter will be attending CISV In Motion? Number of Youth? Number of Adults?** -- 1 adult (Tamas Karakai, President), 1 JB (Eszter Karakai, LJR)
- **Do you have any questions about CISV In Motion?** -- Not really :)
- **Will your Chapter be able to host according to the ten year plan for 2018, 2019 and 2020?** -- If our 10-year plan includes hosting a Village in 2018, then yes, we are working very hard towards it. We are late, have volunteering and fundraising constraints, but we have great support from DFW and more great people started working on it starting September/October. I am not aware of plans for 2019-2020.
- **Did your Chapter host a Mosaic program this year?** -- Yes. Continuing our tradition of hosting a year-round program benefitting refugees arriving at the Austin area, we are doing the same program and expanding on it: not only we have a weekly session at an elementary school (6 sessions in the fall, 6-8 sessions in the spring), but this year a middle school is doing Mosaic for refugees at the same time.
- **How many total volunteer hours did your Chapter have this from Sept - Aug?** -- 20 persons, x 10 months, x 2 weeks, x 10 hours = 4,000
- **Were you able to send complete delegations with correct ages and genders?** -- Yes. One full village delegation and 1 Interchange delegation (6 delegates). One Village delegate girl was 10 years old but was selected based on her maturity, and she proved that it was the right decision: she participated and interacted with equal abilities, with no issues whatsoever.
- **Did you have a Junior Branch meeting or activity each month?** -- No. They had activity about once every two months. The JB was still forming, their board was still finding ways to work together, the JB membership was still getting used to regular activities. It is already looking better this year.
- **Did your leaders live up to your expectations and their obligations this year?** -- Yes. Both our village leader and our Interchange leader was excellent, both the kids, as well as the parents gave very positive feedback on them.
- **Did any particular issues with parents or delegates arise?** -- Parents: nothing significant. Delegates: nothing significant with delegates we sent, but there was an Italian Interchange delegate posing difficulties for his host families. This was reported.
- **What is your Chapter's plan for keeping the new delegates engaged and involved in the Junior Branch?** -- Consistent and predictable JB events (have a schedule of meetings and activities planned at least 4-6 months in advance). Minicamp, pool party, fundraising events, volunteering events, cultural events, scavenger hunt event, and more coming in the spring. We also invite the new delegates to talk about their experience at recruiting and other events.
- **Has the Chapter President and JB President collaborated on anything this year?** -- Not much. On specific events, like the minicamp the collaboration was good, but in general, the communication has some challenges.     Starting September, it already much better. The JB President is participating in adult board meetings, listening in and giving updates about JB activities. The collaboration is smooth and continuous. Big help comes also from our JB Advisor who actively helps both adult and JB side.
- **Is there anything that the National Office can do to make your job easier?** -- Not really. We are getting very good support and encouragement from the National Office.
- **Do you have any questions or concerns for the Board of Directors?** -- Not really. Keep up the good work and thank you! :)

 - Is there going to be a 2016 Audit? If yes, when? Rumors not to have it?
 - Any advice to use or not to use local EIN? North East Ohio used it successfully!
