# Call with Bob fundraising - 08/30/2017 12:30

### Participants:
 * Bianca,
 * Jose Uribe
 * Bob

Bob:
 * Alumni should be big
 * Ask DFW about alumni
 * Use non-ask information in the future, not just ask for money
 * My job:
  * Identify prospects
  * Generate proposals
  * Strategy
  * Village and step-up for the most part
  * Corporate sponsorship too
  * This might shift due to International
  * Helping with the Global Conference next year

Bianca:
 * Bob, what is the best strategy? Corporate, foundations, etc.?

Bob:
 * These are all the same, corporate or foundation, focus all of the efforts should go there.
 * Should not do more events, focus.
 * Non-hosting years should still keep the communication, keep the name known
 * I would add the list of companies to the prospect list, pitch them too

Bianca:
 * The grant list is from GuideStar.com. Any list of corporate foundations?

Bob:
 * This list is both family and corporate

Jose:
 * Are there templates on how to market?

Bob:
 * Cover letter is available.
 * Sponsorship letter is also available. The levels are widely variable, even $250 to $1,000, to keep the entry low, but some chapters insisted that anything is worth doing that $1,000. I recommend low amounts too.
 * My experience is that chapters have trouble with the process, especially with the labor intensive vetting process.






 Call with Bianca
 09/12/2017 8pm:

 - Ignore Houston due to hurricanes
 - Rule out religious organizations
 - will meet with her friend to narrow down to local foundations
